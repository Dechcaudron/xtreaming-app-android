This is Xtreaming app's blog, currently participating in the open source contest CUSL 2016.

Xtreaming is a music streaming client designed to give the user control over what they play. Within the app, you can link different music repositories and gain simultaneous access to all of them.

Mobile device storage space is scarce and expensive. You can store your music within, or inside an SD card which could be used to store videos, photos or anything else. What's more, keeping your music library updated in your phone ends up being a tedious task when it comes to organizing playlists, favoriting tracks and so on, so you end up recurring to third party app's which allow you to listen to music many times you already own and paid for, while having to listen to annoying ads or pay a monthly fee.

Not that there's anything wrong with doing that to listen to music you don't own, or to explore new music. But paying to listen to music you already own? Not in for that, sorry. So that's why Xtreaming was born.

In the beggining, Xtreaming was conceived as both server and client, until a friend of mine came to me and said: "I found a perfectly working server". Why reinvent the wheel? So Xtreaming moved on to be just the client side, communicating with one or more servers of yours.

Currently, Xtreaming only works with [Koel](https://github.com/phanan/koel), but it is designed to be able to work with different service models so long as they have a REST API. So if you are developing a server and want Xtreaming to be compatible with it, contact us!

Note that Xtreaming is currently in a very early development stage, but feel free to comment on it, or if you are a developer, don't hesitate to fork it on [Github](https://github.com/Dechcaudron/xtreaming-app-android) and make as many changes as you want. If you code something you consider the official app should have, please submit a pull request and we will review it!
